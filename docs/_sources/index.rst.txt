Brownie Safe: Gnosis Safe transaction builder
====================================

Brownie Safe (previously known as Ape Safe) allows you to iteratively build complex multi-step Gnosis Safe transactions and safely preview their side effects from the convenience of a locally forked mainnet environment.

It is powered by Brownie_ and builds upon SafeEthPy_, extending it with additional capabilities.
This tool has been informally known as Chief Multisig Officer at Yearn_ and has been used to prepare complex transactions with great success.
